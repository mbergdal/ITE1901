Create an ToDoApp

1. Make it possible to add an ToDoItem
    (Use an ArrayList to store items to start with)
2. Make it possible to get the number of current Items
3. Make it possible to remove an ToDoItem
4. Make it possible to add multiple items from an existing List<ToDoItem>
    Test this with adding at least 100000 items

5. Change your implementation to use a LinkedList. All your tests should still pass.

6. Make it possible to remove a specific ToDoItem based on its title
7. Make it possible to give each item an priority from 1 to 3
8. Make it possible to get items sorted on priority (both ascending and descending)

9. Change the implementation to use a Map to store the items
    Use the title as key and the ToDoItem as value
    Update all tests to pass using this new implementation
